# QUEST OF LEARNING QUESTS

When I have/want to learn something of design, first I give myself 5 minutes to create a workflow, a way to learn the concepts I need the most eficient way (don't want to be there half a day), so this is the little work I did:

- What exactly is a quest?
- What relevance does it have?
- How I identify bad/good quests?
- How to actually create quests?
- Little clues to improve on creating

We will follow this kind of thoughs through the document, hope this helps you define everything better in your head.

So:

## What is a quest 
(I will stop writing mission after quests at this point)

WIKIPEDIA: 
"A quest, or mission, is a task in video games that a player-controlled character, party, or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward."

ME:
"Little stories that help the player:
- Gain strengh (gameplay)
- Learn mechanics
- Get to know more about characters
- Learn about the amazing world we are creating"

When I mention little stories, what I meant is that a quest have the same process and elements of the story(narrative of a game):

- An objective
- An obstacle
- Evolution of the character
- Etc (check https://youtu.be/8fXE-E1hjKk to find a lot of narrative advice)

### Type of quests
This is not very important, but there are actually two main type of quests:

#### Main quests
The ones that contribute to the main hitory, you must finish them to reach to final, the real difference is the reward you give (not just item and exp reward, but also narrative evolution and lore knowledge!) and the intensity you design them with.

#### Side quests
Those are more of little histories of their own (of course you can be original and twist them or chain them or whatever you think) that can be or not completed to reach the final point in the history. Take care not to give too many rewards or the BBEG (big bad evil guy, more known as final boss) will be easy. As reward, depending of the type of player you are tarjeting you can give different rewards, like unique skins or customization items, new zones to explore, new characters to befriend or lore (explorers are persons too, we all don't prefer skins to knowledge).

REMEMBER: It does not matter what kind of quest is, the design of the quest is the same.
But the most important thing I learnt through my process of research is: DO NOT CREATE A GOBLIN/ORC KILLING QUEST!

## Good/bad things in quests

### Create narrative
You will be tempted to create some kind of learn the mechanics tutorial quest, but please think about it twice. You will find the player getting bored when the game hasn't even beginned yet. The reason, the narrative! As I said quests are little histories, you need to get the player in the magic circle, and giving him a tedious task to get trough the tutorial won't be good for this. Instead, try adding some narrative and twist to the quest and you will find the player is awaiting to start the quest, for example: "An orc sanctuary near the town is shining every night and some magicians recognized some spells being used, you as a player is needed to go there and kill the orcs that are playing with this dark magic". A quests should be a way to show the world to your players, to make them feel like they are inside of it, so use quests to create the history of your character/player. 

### Balance stages of the quests
If you have followed narrative class (probably not) you will remember that every narrative setting have 3 stages: the introduction, a second act where the action happens and the finalle, where you get the reward and the narrative ends.

Basically, you need to keep a balance in every stage of the quests, do not extend the intro(set up of the quests) too much like final fantasy 14 online, where you have to trabel a or talk a lot and it's tedious, but do show the player the world is big enough that he can get lost in it. The same can be aplied for all the other 2 stages. 

### Don't be afraid to be creative

What I've seen in a lot of youtube videos explaining quests is this concept, being afraid to innovate or being creative. What I think they meant is to not be afraid of change. In this stage, where we all have been 2 years in unversity, we are not afraid to screw up or to not find ideas anymore, the problem (at least to me) is that a lot of new ideas traduces in changing the plot or modifying the world, being creative also means accepting and adapting to new ideas, so don't be afraid to accept strange or innovative ideas, even though they take away some of your old work.

### Quests as a way of worldbuilding

I've said it before but use all king of quests to show the player the world you have in your mind, create characters that evolve and have problems and use quests to just expand what you have created. The player will value more a new zone where there is an incredible mission where he can explore and fight some baddies that some mission to kill goblins.
