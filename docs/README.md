# QUEST OF LEARNING QUESTS

When I have/want to learn something of design, first I give myself 5 minutes to create a workflow, a way to learn the concepts I need the most eficient way (don't want to be there half a day), so this is the little work I did:

- What exactly is a quest?
- What relevance does it have?
- How I identify bad/good quests?
- How to actually create quests?
- Little clues to improve on creating

We will follow this kind of thoughs through the document, hope this helps you define everything better in your head.

So:

## What is a quest 
(I will stop writing mission after quests at this point)

WIKIPEDIA: 
"A quest, or mission, is a task in video games that a player-controlled character, party, or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward."

ME:
"Little stories that help the player:
- Gain strengh (gameplay)
- Learn mechanics
- Get to know more about characters
- Learn about the amazing world you are creating"
- Create their own history in the world

When I mention little stories, what I mean is that a quest have the same process and elements of a story(narrative of a game):

- An objective
- An obstacle
- Evolution of the character
- Etc (check https://youtu.be/8fXE-E1hjKk to find a lot of narrative advice)

### Type of quests
This is not very important, but there are actually two main type of quests:

#### Main quests
The ones that contribute to the main hitory, you must finish them to reach to final, the real difference is the reward you give (not just item and exp reward, but also narrative evolution and lore knowledge!) and the intensity you design them with.

#### Side quests
Those are more of little histories of their own (of course you can be original and twist them or chain them or whatever you think) that can be or not completed to reach the final point in the history. Take care not to give too many rewards or the BBEG (big bad evil guy, more known as final boss) will be easy. As reward, depending of the type of player you are tarjeting you can give different rewards, like unique skins or customization items, new zones to explore, new characters to befriend or lore (explorers are persons too, we all don't prefer skins to knowledge).

REMEMBER: It does not matter what kind of quest is, the design of the quest is the same.

On top of all of that, here comes the most important thing I learnt through my process of research is: DO NOT CREATE A GOBLIN/ORC KILLING QUEST!

## Good/bad things in quests

### Create narrative
You will be tempted to create some kind of learn the mechanics tutorial quest, but please think about it twice. You will find the player getting bored when the game hasn't even beginned yet. The reason, the narrative! As I said quests are little histories, you need to get the player in the magic circle, and giving him a tedious task to get trough the tutorial won't be good for this. Instead, try adding some narrative and twist to the quest and you will find the player is awaiting to start the quest, for example: "An orc sanctuary near the town is shining every night and some magicians recognized some spells being used, you as a player is needed to go there and kill the orcs that are playing with this dark magic". A quests should be a way to show the world to your players, to make them feel like they are inside of it, so use quests to create the history of your character/player. 

### Balance stages of the quests
If you have followed narrative class (probably not) you will remember that every narrative setting have 3 stages: the introduction, a second act where the action happens and the finalle, where you get the reward and the narrative ends.

Basically, you need to keep a balance in every stage of the quests, do not extend the intro(set up of the quests) too much like final fantasy 14 online, where you have to trabel a or talk a lot and it's tedious, but do show the player the world is big enough that he can get lost in it. The same can be aplied for all the other 2 stages. 

### Don't be afraid to be creative

What I've seen in a lot of youtube videos explaining quests is this concept, being afraid to innovate or being creative. What I think they meant is to not be afraid of change. In this stage, where we all have been 2 years in unversity, we are not afraid to screw up or to not find ideas anymore, the problem (at least to me) is that a lot of new ideas traduces in changing the plot or modifying the world, being creative also means accepting and adapting to new ideas, so don't be afraid to accept strange or innovative ideas, even though they take away some of your old work.

### Quests as a way of worldbuilding

I've said it before but use all king of quests to show the player the world you have in your mind, create characters that evolve and have problems and use quests to just expand what you have created. The player will value more a new zone where there is an incredible mission where he can explore and fight some baddies that some mission to kill goblins.

### Make sure the quest is avaliable and easy to acces to

It happened to me being a DM(dungeon master), the players wouldn't reach the NPC that would give them and important piece of information and a new mission. I could fix it because DnD is in real-time, but being a designer is diferent. That takes me to the next point.

### Playtest a LOT

You will need to try new quests so ask a few friends, other teams(from project 2), ask for social networks (or ask me, happy to help) and get a bunch of people that has a little of experience in RPG and get them to try just the quests, are they playable as an individual adventure, do the quests fit in the history, are the rewards enough, does the intensity works well? All questions can be asked thanks to playtesting. Oh, and remember we have a Q&A team member so he can help manage the feedback.

### Gameplay does not mean action

A lot of quests don't need fight to be exciting, for example, in zelda breath of the wild, a very good example on quests(I think), there are a lot of side quests where you don't actually fight monsters, and it is equally fine. Instead give the players a puzzle or an exploration part with a lot of rewards to make them feel motivate and engaged. Again remember the kind of player you are designing for and this will end up well.

## Process of creating quests

I actually have a very little experience creating quests and I am not sure how to tell you how to do it. I searched through the internet and nobody is disposed to tell to other their though process, so I will do my best in some points I found in talks and from myself.

### My own process

Basically I try to take it into roleplaying tabletop games. I played a bit and I've been a master for one or two "one-shots" (one meeting history that starts and concludes). First I ask myself what I need from that quest. Is it a new item they need for the story (doors and keys like metroidvanias) or it is a way to give the player more power? Maybe it is just to add more story to the adventure or present a new NPC, etc... There are a lot of options and knowing what it the first priority is always good in design. After knowing the objective of the quest I make a brainstorm of limited time, like 1 hour or 1 day (remember to bring always something to write or save thoughs). I don't sit and think about what I need, i do other work or hobbies, and my brain will eventually end up spacing out and having some ideas. Any other kind of process of brainstorming here will work too, the objective is to have a lot of ideas were we can pick the one that fits the most. From there the designer/writer will expand the idea and the programmer will implement it, so it is downhill from here. A good idea is to keep a map or timeline to show all the quests to keep track of consistency. 

REMEMBER:

- Give time to stormbrain, it is hard to creat a large list of ideas
- Don't give the task of creating new ideas/things to the designer, all team members in a small team can have and present good ideas

## Grinding

Okay, last part of the document, grinding, we will define like this:

"Position in time where the player ways to progress are limited to the ones that does are not designed for that level or point in time". Basically players don't have enough experience to advance to the next challenge due to dificulty or soft block and has to keep killing goblins and orcs to get to the next point in the game. From my experience this may happen for diferent reasons:

- The combat or soft block in front is deisnged to be hard and the player don't have enough skill (strategic or mechanical) to beat the soft block. It happened to me when I was little in mario and luigi traveling through time, I LOVED the game but at one point I could not beat the Thwomp boss (I think), I had not enough skill and I ended up not finishing the game. The remorse keeps inside me 10 years later :(. A way to fix this and a good rule is: for every boss battle, the developer of the boss must be able to pass the boss hitless. It may be a little too harsh but that worked for Hollow Knight
- Calculus of experience. Even with side quests the player must be able to beat the soft block
